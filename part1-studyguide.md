# Part 1: The Big Picture (What does this thing do?)

This section aims to provide a high-level understanding of the `restapisummarizer` application from a user's perspective. Before diving into the code, it's crucial to grasp what the tool is designed to do and how a user would interact with it.

## 1. Review the `README.md`

The `README.md` file is the primary source of information for any new user or developer. It typically contains:

*   **Project Purpose:** A concise explanation of what the `restapisummarizer` does.
*   **Features:** A list of its main capabilities.
*   **Installation Instructions:** How to get the application up and running.
*   **Basic Usage:** Examples of how to use the commands.

By reading the `README.md`, you should be able to answer questions like: "What problem does this tool solve?" and "How do I get started with it?"

## 2. Run `restapisummarizer --help`

For CLI applications, the `--help` flag is invaluable. It provides a dynamic, up-to-date overview of all available commands, subcommands, and flags. This is often more reliable than static documentation, as it reflects the current state of the executable.

Running `restapisummarizer --help` will show you:

*   The main command (`restapisummarizer`).
*   A brief description of the application.
*   A list of available commands (e.g., `sum`, `config`).
*   Global flags that can be used with any command.

This helps in understanding the overall command structure and the functionalities exposed to the user.

## 3. Discuss Main Commands: `sum` and `config`

Based on the `README.md` and the `--help` output, the two primary commands are `sum` and `config`.

*   **`sum` command:** This is the core functionality of the application. It's responsible for scanning codebases, identifying REST API endpoints, and generating summaries for them. It will likely have flags to specify the input directory, output format, and perhaps the programming language/framework.

*   **`config` command:** This command is used to manage the application's settings. This typically includes setting up API keys (e.g., for the Google Gemini API), configuring default paths, or other persistent preferences. It often has subcommands like `set` (to set a value) and `get` (to retrieve a value).

Understanding these two commands and their high-level purposes provides a strong foundation for exploring the codebase in more detail.
