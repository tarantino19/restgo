# Study Guide: Understanding the `restapisummarizer` Codebase - Part 2: Project Structure

Welcome back! In this section, we'll explore the directory structure of the `restapisummarizer` project. Understanding where files are located and why they are there is crucial for navigating any codebase, especially in Go projects which follow certain conventions.

## Part 2: Project Structure (Where is everything?)

**Goal:** Learn the layout of the codebase.

### 1. Main Directories

Let's look at the top-level directories in our project:

```
/Users/tarantino/Desktop/restapisummarizer/
├───cmd/             # Command-line interface (CLI) commands
├───internal/        # Private application logic (not importable by other Go modules)
├───pkg/             # Public libraries (safe for other Go modules to import)
├───scripts/         # Helper scripts (installation, packaging)
├───.git/            # Git version control data
├───.github/         # GitHub Actions workflows
├───go.mod           # Go module definition and dependencies
├───go.sum           # Checksums for module dependencies
├───main.go          # Application entry point
├───Makefile         # Build automation
├───README.md        # Project documentation
└───restapisummarizer # Compiled binary (after building)
```

### 2. Purpose of Each Directory

*   **`cmd/`**: This directory contains the main packages for the executable commands of your application. Each subdirectory under `cmd/` typically represents a distinct command. For `restapisummarizer`, you'll find `root.go` (the main command), `sum.go` (for the `sum` command), and `config.go` (for the `config` command).

    *Example: `cmd/root.go` defines the base `restapisummarizer` command.* 

*   **`internal/`**: This is a special directory in Go. Code within `internal/` cannot be imported by other Go modules outside of *this* module. It's used for application-specific private code that you don't want to expose as a public API. For `restapisummarizer`, this is where most of our core logic resides:
    *   `analyzer/`: Contains the logic for scanning files and identifying API patterns.
    *   `cache/`: Handles caching mechanisms.
    *   `config/`: Manages application configuration.
    *   `formatter/`: Responsible for formatting the output (e.g., tables).
    *   `gemini/`: Contains the client for interacting with the Google Gemini API.

    *Example: `internal/analyzer/analyzer.go` contains the core scanning logic.* 

*   **`pkg/`**: This directory is for public libraries that are safe for other Go modules to import and use. If you were building a library that other developers might use in their own Go projects, its public API would go here. In `restapisummarizer`, we have:
    *   `models/`: Defines data structures (models) used across the application, such as `endpoint.go`.

    *Example: `pkg/models/endpoint.go` defines the structure of an API endpoint.* 

*   **`scripts/`**: This directory holds various utility scripts, such as installation scripts (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`) and package manager configurations.

### 3. `go.mod` and `go.sum`

These two files are fundamental to Go Modules, Go's dependency management system.

*   **`go.mod`**: This file defines the module path (e.g., `github.com/tarantino19/restgo`), the Go version the module requires, and lists all the direct and indirect dependencies your project uses. When you add a new dependency, it gets recorded here.

    *Snippet from `go.mod`:*
    ```go
    module github.com/tarantino19/restgo

    go 1.24.2

    require (
    	github.com/fatih/color v1.18.0
    	github.com/google/generative-ai-go v0.20.1
    	// ... other dependencies
    )
    ```

*   **`go.sum`**: This file contains the cryptographic checksums of the content of your module's dependencies. Go uses this to verify that the dependencies haven't been tampered with, ensuring reproducible builds.

### 4. Main Entry Point: `main.go`

Every executable Go program must have a `main` package and a `main.go` file containing a `main()` function. This is where your program starts execution.

In `restapisummarizer`, `main.go` is very simple. Its primary job is to call the `Execute()` function from the `cmd` package, which then takes over the command-line parsing and execution.

*Snippet from `main.go`:*
```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/tarantino19/restgo/cmd"
)

func main() {
	cmd.Execute()
}
```
